# ​为3ds Max安装Verge3D​

正确安装Verge3D后，其可在Autodesk 3ds Max 2019 ~ 2015版本中运行。如果您还没有购买该软件，可以在Autodesk[官方网站](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/free-trial)下载试用版，或者使用Verge3D for Blender作为替换.

Verge3D can run on top of Autodesk 3ds Max 2019 to 2015 which should be installed first. If this is not the case, you can download a free trial bundle from Autodesk's [website](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/free-trial), or try Verge3D for Blender instead.

### Download and Run Verge3D Installer

[Download Verge3D](https://www.soft8soft.com/get-verge3d/) and run the installer. Choose the installation folder that have enough permissions for reading and writing. Installing in a system directory such as "Program Files" is not recommended.![](https://www.soft8soft.com/docs/files/installation_3ds_max/installer-max-auto-configure.jpg)

Once the installation is complete, be sure to **re-open 3ds Max**. You should see "Verge3D" in the main menu bar.![](https://www.soft8soft.com/docs/files/installation_3ds_max/installation_3ds_max_complete.jpg)

### Configuring Plugin Path Manually

If you disabled **Auto-Configure** option in the installer, or installed a new version of 3ds Max, or switched the Windows user, you can use the following procedure to configure the plugin path.

Run 3ds Max, and select "Configure System Paths..." under "Customize" in the main menu bar.![](https://www.soft8soft.com/docs/files/installation_3ds_max/installation_3ds_max1.png)

### Troubleshooting

In some cases the Verge3D menu does not show up in the main menu bar. To register the menu manually, go to "Utilities", click "MaxScript" and select "Verge3D" in the dropdown menu. Then click "Register Verge3D menu".![](https://www.soft8soft.com/docs/files/installation_3ds_max/installation_3ds_max-registering_manually.jpg)
